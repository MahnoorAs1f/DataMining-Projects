Emotional Response Classification Using Machine Learning (Python)

🧠 Project Overview:
This project is focused on analyzing and classifying emotional responses based on a dataset of features using machine learning models. The entire analysis is conducted in Python using Jupyter Notebooks, and includes data visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to understand how different features contribute to predicting a person’s emotional response and to visualize the patterns hidden in the data.

🔍 Objectives:
Explore and visualize the dataset using various statistical and graphical tools.

Identify relationships and correlations between features and emotional response.

Train and evaluate machine learning models (Decision Tree, Naive Bayes).

Compare model performances and visualize key insights such as feature importance.

🛠️ Technologies and Tools Used:
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas – for data manipulation

matplotlib & seaborn – for visualizations

scikit-learn – for model training (Decision Tree & Naive Bayes)

PNG Images – for visual presentation of heatmaps, pairplots, feature importance, and more

📊 Key Components of the Project:
Basic Visualizations:

Performed using seaborn and matplotlib

Includes pair plots, scatter plots, density plots, and boxplots

Helps reveal data distribution and relationship patterns by emotional category

Heatmap:

Correlation heatmap used to visualize the strength and direction of relationships between numerical features.

Highlights which features are most relevant to emotional response.

Decision Tree Model:

Built to classify emotional responses.

Model is evaluated, and feature importance is visualized to show which inputs affect predictions most.

Naive Bayes Model:

Another classification approach applied to the same data.

Results are compared with the decision tree to evaluate accuracy and performance.

Model Comparison & Insights:

Side-by-side visual and numeric comparison between models.

Includes accuracy scores and interpretation of model behavior based on visual outputs.

📈 Visual Outputs Included:
Boxplots: Showing spread of features grouped by emotional response

Density plots: Indicating overlapping feature distributions

Correlation Heatmap: Understanding inter-feature relationships

Pairplots and scatter plots: Exploring feature relationships

Feature Importance Plot: Highlighting the impact of each feature in the decision tree

Tree and Classification Graphs: Diagrammatic representation of decision logic

📘 Project Description: ( RapidMiner  )
This project  is a comprehensive data analytics assignment that demonstrates the complete process of data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using the RapidMiner software. The report follows a structured methodology and is divided into clearly defined sections, each reflecting a key phase in a data mining pipeline.

📌 Objective of the Project
The main purpose of this lab project is to:

Apply various data preprocessing techniques in RapidMiner.

Understand how to handle real-world datasets with missing values, irrelevant attributes, and duplicates.

Implement and compare data mining models for classification.

Evaluate model performance using RapidMiner’s built-in tools.

🧹 Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing phase is essential to clean and prepare the dataset for accurate analysis. The following operators were used in RapidMiner:

Select Attributes

Used to select only the relevant columns/features from the dataset.

Replace Missing Values

Handles null or missing data using predefined strategies (mean, mode, etc.).

Remove Duplicates

Ensures that no repeated records affect the analysis by removing exact duplicates.

🧠 Modeling and Analysis
After preprocessing, several classification models were applied to the dataset to predict outcomes based on the cleaned data. Models likely used include:

Decision Tree

Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

Each model was trained and tested using cross-validation, and their performance was evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

Confusion Matrix

📊 Visualization and Results
Workflow diagrams were created using RapidMiner’s drag-and-drop interface to visualize the full process.

Results were displayed in tabular and graphical forms directly within RapidMiner.

Comparisons were made between models to determine which gave the best predictive performance.
